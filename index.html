    <p><h1>Thor </h1>
    <h4>Thor Odinson is a fictional character portrayed by Chris Hemsworth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) film franchise,
        based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. In the films, Thor is known as the "God of Thunder", 
        and is one of the most powerful of the Asgardians, an alien civilization with long ties to Earth, 
        who are therefore considered by some on Earth to be gods.</h4></p>
